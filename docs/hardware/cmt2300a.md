## Description

The CMT2300A module is a 868MHz RF module. It is important to get a module which supports SPI communication. Currently only the [EBYTE E49-900M20S](https://www.ebyte.com/en/pdf-down.aspx?id=2506){target=_blank} is supported as a standalone module, or use the OpenDTUFusion integrated PCB instead.

The CMT2300A uses 3-Wire half duplex SPI communication. Due to this fact it currently requires a separate SPI bus. If you want to run the CMT2300A module on the same ESP32 as a NRF24L01+ module or a PCD8544 display make sure you get a ESP which supports 2 SPI busses. Currently the SPI bus host is hardcoded to number 2. This may change in future.

Buy your hardware from a trusted source, at best from a dealer/online shop in your country where you have support and the right to return non-functional hardware. When you want to buy from Amazon, AliExpress, eBay etc., take note that there is a lot of low-quality or fake hardware offered. Read customer comments and ratings carefully!

A heavily incomplete list of shops is:

* [EBYTE E49-900M20S](https://ebyteiot.com/products/ebyte-e49-900m20s-cmt2300a-868-915mhz-smd-wireless-module-spi-hardware-module-long-range-3km-ipex-stamp-hole-antenna-wireless-module){target=_blank}
* [Antenna](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=B0978Q7N7C){target=_blank}
* [Blinkyparts (incl. breakout board)](https://shop.blinkyparts.com/de/Ebyte-Funkmodul-CMT2300A-868-915MHz-Breakoutboard/blink238542){target=_blank}

This list is for your convenience only, the project is not related to any of these shops.

## Pin assignment

The connection pins from the CMT2300A module to the ESP32 module can dynamically configured using [Device Profiles](../firmware/device_profiles.md) (prefered method) or at compile time.

| Name in Device Profile | Pin Function | Description | Possible name(s) on PCB |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------------- |
| sdio | Digital Input/Output | SPI Data Input/Output | SDIO |
| clk | Digital Input | SPI Clock | SCLK |
| cs | Digital Input | SPI register accesser | CSB |
| fcs | Digital Input | SPI FIFO accesser | FCSB |
| gpio2 | Digital Output | Interrupt pin | GPIO2 |
| gpio3 | Digital Output | Interrupt pin | GPIO3 |
|    | Power | Power Supply (1,8V - 3.6V) | VDD, VCC |
|    | Power | Ground | VSS, GND |
